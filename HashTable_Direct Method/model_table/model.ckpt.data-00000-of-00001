This delay concerns only the registration of the error, not the reaction. If this error occur without the emergency stop has been pressed the reason might be an error in the emergency, VOG, or thermistor circuit.It is controlled that the phase sequence on the grid is correct. The monitoring can be disabled with (P6,1) parameter.The CT3251 processor has not been able to measure the phase Sequence, perhaps because of a very instable grid frequency or voltage.The CT3503 GND processor has not received a status telegram from the CT3251 processor, with information about phase sequence.The Top processor has not been able to change the operation state within 3 sec (P14,52).The grid processor has not been able to change the operation state within 3 sec (P14, 52).Internal system errorThe response from the bypassing is active.The feedback from the bypassing is not correct in 1000msec (P14, 12).

This error can be due to a defect, or an iced anemometer. If the turbine has a tower anemometer installed, then it is important that the error is corrected because the anemometer signal is part of a blade deflection reduction feature (PS3-operation).When the power exceeds 950 o/oo (P4, 21) of nominal power (P9, 52) it is checked, that the anemometer shows least 8.0 m/s (P4, 22).

The Q8 can trip by itself, due to a high current, or ground fault. The controller can trip Q8 due to-Over voltage, If a turbine has a tripped Q8, the grid voltage has to be checked before the breaker is closed, and controller is started. When the controller is started, it can be seen in the log if the controller has tripped the breaker. On a V47 the controller is started by pressing the service button. In order to start the controller the breaker Q16 has to be closed.

I.e this courses the turbine to PAUSE within 0-10 sec. and Emergency after 60 sec. When the temperature is above 0Â°C, the computer is started again. The reason can be-Misajustment of thermostat, -error in heating element or PTS5, -or the ambient temperature is below (-20Â°C.)One of the tree surge arrestors is damaged, and Signal S9 is disabledThe combination of signals from the yaw control indicates an error in the signals, or the turbine is over yawing the cables. All 3 signals are deactivated or S102 and S103 are active at the same time.S105 has not changed level after continuous yawing in the same direction in 900 sec. (P2, 7).

If the difference between the actual power and the internal power reference has been higher than (P9, 179) kW, the difference is attenuated exponential with a time constant of 60 msec (P9, 178). If the power is positive (E.g. Power Error 75 kW) then the actual power is higher than the reference, and the reason is fluctuations in power.nannannannannannannannannannannannannannanThe temperature in the gear oil has been under -5 Â°C (P4,81), and not above -2 Â°C (P4.82) again in 20 Sec.

If the turbine after reaction to a feedback error still has a feedback 1, the Q8 is tripped after (P14, 18) s. If the faulted contactor is K700/K705 then the delay is only one sec. This is not supervised in service mode. The name of offending contactor can be seen in the previous log message. The Q8 can trip by itself, due to a high current, or ground fault. The controller can trip Q8 due to.If a turbine has a tripped Q8, the grid voltage has to be checked before the breakers are closed, and controller is started. When the controller is started, it can be seen in the log if the controller has tripped the breaker. The controller is started by pressing the service button. In order to start the controller the breaker Q16 has to be closed. If only one of the breakers has tripped, then the breaker has tripped by itself.nanLogged if the ambient temperature is higher than 45Â°C (P4.13)The error occurs if the turbine still has high current after disconnecting the generator. The Q8 can trip by itself, due to a high current, or ground fault. The controller can trip Q8 due toIf a turbine has a tripped Q8, the grid voltage has to be checked before the breaker is closed, and controller is started. When the controller is started, it can be seen in the log if the controller has tripped the breaker. On a PS-600 kW WEG the controller is started by pressing the service button. In order to start the controller the breaker Q16 has to be closed. If only one of the breakers has tripped, then the breaker has tripped by itself.The error occurs if the under voltage is higher than 250o/oo (P1, 34) of nominal voltage (P1, 119) in 80 ms (P1, 36)nannanThe difference between the measured power and the measured wind is too high. The wind is corrected for mass, and converted to power by a power curve described by (P9.157) and (P9.158). The measured and calculated power is averaged in a first order filter with a tau of (P9.159) s. If the measured power is (9.160) o/oo above the calculated power (power curve) the error is reported. If the measured power is (9.161) o/oo below the calculated power (power curve) the error is reportednannanPitch position sensor supervision (Balluf). If the measured voltage is not inside the adjusted limits, incl. tolerances, of the Balluf end stop an error message is given. Furthermore an error is messaged if the positioning sensor has detected a pitch speed that is not mechanical possible. Error adjustment of Balluf is not correct. Electrical noise.

The wind vane cannot move as fast as measured.nannannannannannannannannannannannannannannannanWhen the generator speed exceeds 1000 o/oo (P4, 18) of synchronous speed it is checked that the anemometer shows at least (P4, 19) m/s. This error can be due to a defect or an iced up anemometer. It is important that the error is corrected because the anemometer signal is part of a blade deflection reduction feature (PS3-operation). Note! It has been observed that this error can occur without the anemometer being defect. Then the error occurs in low wind when the wind is in a direction which leaves the anemometer in the tower wake. In this case the error can be ignored.The vertical (negative) wind shear exceeds the permissible limit (par. 9.259 "E-1 m/s Min. Wind shear limit"). The wind shear limit depends on the PS3 parameter set used in the turbine (PS3.A or PS3.B, see the individual parameter configuration document for the software release in question). If a PS3.A turbine experiences "too many" of this wind shear error then upgrade the turbine to a PS3.B turbine. If a PS3.B turbine experiences these errors no action is to be taken.This supervision is only active when the oil temperature is above 40 deg.C (S425MinTempLimitPx).Communication problem longer than 60 sec.

Error correction instruction:1) Retrieve the vdf-buffer from the turbine. Check that the VMP parameters in group 9 and 11 are according to the service bulletin. 2) If The parameters are correct check the condition of the gear torque arms, e.g. what is the clearance between the disc springs? Send a short description of the condition of the gear torque arms along with the vdf-buffer and ram-dump to your technical support department further analysis. If the dominating oscillation frequency in the generator speed (above 0.5 Hz) is the 3P frequency (f3p=3*rotor rpm/60 [Hz]) the error is caused by extreme wind conditions and not defect gear torque arms or wrong parameters. If the dominating oscillation is between 2 and 3 Hz the gear torque arms probably are defect.
