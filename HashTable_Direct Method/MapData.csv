This error can be due to a defect or an iced up anemometer. It is important that the error is corrected because the anemometer signal is part of a blade deflection reduction feature (PS3-operation). Note! It has been observed that this error can occur without the anemometer being defect. Then the error occurs in low wind when the wind is in a direction which leaves the anemometer in the tower wake. In this case the error can be ignored.",

If a PS3.A turbine experiences ""too many"" of this wind shear error then upgrade the turbine to a PS3.B turbine. If a PS3.B turbine experiences these errors no action is to be taken.",

Error correction instruction:1) Retrieve the vdf-buffer from the turbine. Check that the VMP parameters in group 9 and 11 are according to the service bulletin. 2) If The parameters are correct check the condition of the gear torque arms, e.g. what is the clearance between the disc springs? Send a short description of the condition of the gear torque arms along with the vdf-buffer and ram-dump to your technical support department further analysis. If the dominating oscillation frequency in the generator speed (above 0.5 Hz) is the 3P frequency (f3p=3*rotor rpm/60 [Hz]) the error is caused by extreme wind conditions and not defect gear torque arms or wrong parameters. If the dominating oscillation is between 2 and 3 Hz the gear torque arms probably are defect.",
