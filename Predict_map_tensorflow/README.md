# Loading Session and Mapping input to output
Problem Statement:- I have a dataset where I need to map two columns( Error_code and Criteria) i.e
for a specific error code I must get a Criteria Value.

 Tools:- Python 3.6, Tensorflow 1.4

 Implementation:-
 In [Train_map_tensorflow](https://github.com/RonakDedhiya/HashTable-Mapping-using-tensorflow/tree/master/Train_map_tensorflow) , we have did preprocessing with data and saved it in variable.
 Here we are using variable directly, loading it and mapping input to output

 The code is explained in detail with commets in MapDataPy.py
